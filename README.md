This repo contains a ZMK config
for the Glove80.
I'm trying to have both the original ZMK
build pipeline as well as the MoErgo maintained 
fork, which includes some additional features for the Glove80.

The original ZMK build requires the config files to be at the filesystem root,
so the `boards, config, build.yaml` files are for the original pipeline.

The `moergo_.*` prefix is for the MoErgo ZMK fork build.
